This project is a Barbecue Calculator, a React application created to practice using Formik and Yup for dynamic forms. It allows users to:
	
  â€¢	Input the number of people to calculate the required amount of food.
	â€¢	Select the desired barbecue foods, such as meat, sausage, chicken, and garlic bread.
	â€¢	Validate form fields, ensuring at least one food option is selected and the number of people is valid.
	â€¢	Navigate to a results page that displays the calculated data.

Technologies Used:
	â€¢	React: For building the user interface.
	â€¢	Formik and Yup: For form management and validation.
	â€¢	React Router: For page navigation.
	â€¢	CSS Modules: For modular and organized styling.

This project was developed as part of my learning and practice with Formik and Yup, showcasing how to create dynamic forms with robust validation and scalable design. ðŸš€
